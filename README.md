# Reinforcement learning for quantum state preparation
## Author: Sarang Zambare

This repository is a part of a project I undertook at the *Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay*. I demonstrate a basic way in which reinforcement learning can be used to prepare a given quantum state, from a given initial state.

In this particular demonstration, I keep things simple and assume that the quantum state in question is a two level system, and an arbitrary state can be represented as :
